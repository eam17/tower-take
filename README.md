# Tower Taker
###### Ekaterina Molostvova, Weston Laity

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tower Taker is a Google Maps based game that lets users build and take control of nearby towers, aiming to gain control of as many towers as possible.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First activity is user registration and login. After successful login, the user is taken to a map activity and placed according to their location. There, the user may long-press to place a tower within a 100 ft radius around them, as long as it is at least 100 ft away from any other towers and has the points available to spend. The user may also take control of a nearby enemy tower. Placing a new tower costs 2 in-game coins, while taking control of anotherâ€™s costs 1 coin, to encourage competitiveness. Users gain coins based on the number of towers they have standing at the end of the day; after that the tower is destroyed. If the user has 0 coins at the end of the day, they are automatically assigned 5 coins to continue playing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The user can also access the sliding menu to view the number of their coins and towers. There is also a settings menu where the user can toggle between controlling the map view and the map view following the user as they move.
